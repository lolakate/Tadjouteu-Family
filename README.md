 GitHub hosts repositories using Git, so it shares many commands with Git but also has some unique ones. Common GitHub commands include:

- `git pull`: Fetches changes from a remote repository to a local one.
- `git push`: Uploads local repository content to a remote repository.
- `git clone`: Copies a repository from a remote source to a local machine.
- `git fork`: Creates a personal copy of someone else's project.
- `git pull request`: Creates a request to merge changes from a forked repository to the original one.
- `git merge`: Combines changes from different branches.

GitHub's commands often leverage Git functionality but are tailored for the platform's features like pull requests, forking, issue tracking, etc.
